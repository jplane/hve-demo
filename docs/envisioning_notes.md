# ComfortAI: Smart Home HVAC Control System

## Envisioning Notes

### Core Problems

1. **Temperature Control**: Users need to set specific temperatures for different rooms and times.
2. **Mode Adjustments**: Users want to switch between various modes (e.g., away, eco, sleep) based on their presence and activities.
3. **Comfort Adjustments**: Users need the system to adjust for comfort based on factors like humidity, sun position, and time of day.
4. **Scheduling**: Users want to schedule temperature changes and mode switches in advance.
5. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Users need the system to make dynamic adjustments based on real-time feedback (e.g., feeling chilly, too hot with afternoon sun).

### Examples of Real-World Natural Language Directives

1. **Temperature Control**:
Users should be able to specify exact temperatures for different rooms or the entire home, using either Fahrenheit or Celsius. They may request temperature changes by stating a specific value, ask for relative adjustments (such as making a room cooler or warmer by a certain number of degrees), or set temperatures for particular times or periods.

2. **Mode Adjustments**:
Users should be able to change the system's operational mode based on their activities or presence. They may want to activate modes such as "away," "eco," or "sleep" for specific durations or until a certain time, allowing the system to automatically adjust settings to match their needs and optimize energy usage.

3. **Comfort Adjustments**:
The system should interpret user feedback related to comfort, such as sensations of chilliness, humidity, or discomfort due to sunlight or time of day, and automatically adjust environmental settings to enhance comfort. It should recognize and respond to qualitative input about how the environment feels, making appropriate changes to temperature, humidity, or other relevant factors without requiring users to specify exact values.

4. **Scheduling**:
Users should be able to schedule temperature changes and mode switches based on their planned activities or absences. The system should allow users to specify future times or durations for adjustments, such as preparing the home environment for their return after being away, maintaining specific temperatures during extended absences, or gradually changing settings at designated times. This enables proactive management of comfort and energy efficiency according to the user's schedule.

5. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
The system should be capable of interpreting and responding to user requests for immediate or scheduled adjustments based on real-time feedback. Users may express a need for changes in temperature or comfort settings without specifying exact values, request modifications tailored to current conditions such as seasonal changes, or ask for adjustments to be applied to specific rooms or for certain durations. The system should understand these natural language directives and translate them into appropriate actions, ensuring that comfort preferences are met dynamically and efficiently.

### Known Constraints

1. **Integration with Existing HVAC Systems**: The solution must integrate seamlessly with existing HVAC control systems.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: The system should be easy to use and understand for non-technical users.
3. **Real-Time Processing**: The system must process and respond to user commands in real-time.
4. **Energy Efficiency**: The solution should optimize for energy efficiency, especially when users are away or during eco mode.
5. **Localization**: The system should consider local weather conditions and time zones for accurate adjustments.
